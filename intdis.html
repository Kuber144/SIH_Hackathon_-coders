        <h3>Education Tour to Govt Special School Students</h3>
        <p>The State Government is taking a series of steps to improve the
            quality of education in the Government Schools of the State. The Government
            is committed to provide an atmosphere that is conducive to all-round growth &
            development of children. It is felt that education is imparted not only through
            formal classroom teaching but also through interaction with other children and
            exposure to new places of interest. Hence, traveling and study tours constitute
            an important source of imparting education to children. Needless to say that
            children can be empowered to appreciate and relate theory with practice in a
            better manner through educational tours and exposure.
