        <h3>Financial assisstance to differently abled persons</h3>
        <p>
            The ADIP Scheme has been in operation since 1981 with the main objective to assist the needy disabled persons in procuring durable, sophisticated and scientifically manufactured,
             modern, standard aids and appliances that can promote their physical, social and psychological rehabilitation by reducing the effects of disabilities and enhancing their economic potential. 
              Assistive devices are given to PwDs with an aim to improve their independent functioning and to arrest the extent of disability and occurrence of secondary disability. The aids and appliances 
              supplied under the Scheme must have due certification. The scheme also envisages conduct of corrective surgeries, wherever required, before providing an assistive device. Under the Scheme, grants-in-aid are
               released to various implementing agencies  (Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO)/National Institutes/Composite Regional Centres/District Disability Rehabilitation Centres/ State Handicapped 
               Development Corporations/ NGOs, etc.) for purchase and distribution of aids and assistive devices.  The Scheme was last revised w.e.f. 1.4.2014 and further modified and approved for continuation during 
               the remaining period of the 14th Finance Commission i.e., up to 31.3.2020.

        <h3>Grant of scholarship to differently abled students</h3>
        <p>The objective of the Scheme is to provide financial assistance to the differently-abled students to enable them to pursue professional or technical courses from recognized institutes and get
             employed/self-employed.
            Differently-abled students face several barriers physical, financial, psychological, and mental in pursuing studies and living with dignity. At times such students are deprived of harnessing
             their latent skills and thereby miss the opportunity to earn their livelihood and find a dignified place for themselves in the society. This scheme envisages encouraging differently-abled students 
             by providing scholarships and other assistance to pursue professional or technical courses and various skill development courses for their empowerment.

        <h3>Maintenance allowance to Leprosy perosns</h3>
        <p>In 1989, it was decided that a cash amount of Rs. 300 per month would be given in lieu of these items.  This amount was increased after every few years and at present it is Rs. 1800/- per month. 
            It is paid in the bank account of beneficiaries through Electronic Clearance System (ECS).<br>Maintenance Allowance is given at the rate of Rs. 1,000/- per month to leprosy affected persons. 
            The inmates accommodated in the Government Rehabilitation Homes are also eligible to receive this allowance. The RCL (Rehabilitation Centre for Leprosy Affected Persons) scheme has been implemented since 1981. 
            This scheme was meant for those Leprosy Affected Persons who were permanently residing in Delhi prior to 1981.  This cut off date of 1981 was later extended to 1993. 
            In the beginning, these leprosy affected persons were provided with facilities like dry ration, clothing, bedding, medicines etc.
